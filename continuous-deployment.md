## Introduction
> `Continuous Deployment (CD)` is the process of deploying improvements by defining tests & validation to minimize possible risk.
## Difference between `Continuous Deployment` & `Continous Delivery`
> `Continuous Delivery` ensures that the improved product can be deployed into production while `Continuous Deployment` makes sure they get deployed.
