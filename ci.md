## Introduction
> Continuous Integration (CI) refers to developers continuously pushing small changes to a central Git repository numerous times per day.
These changes are verified by automated software that runs comprehensive tests and ensures that no major issues are ever seen by customers.
## Benefits of CI
• Reduce risks
• Reduce repetitive manual processes
• Generate deployable software at any time and at any place
• Enable better project visibility
• Establish greater confidence in the software product from the
development tea
